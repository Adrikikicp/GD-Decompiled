# GD-Decompiled
 an attempt to get the source code for Geometry Dash through reverse engineering and decompiling the game

## Buy GD

if for some reason you haven't already i recommend you go and buy GD

- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometryjump&hl=en_GB&gl=US)
- [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geometry-dash/id625334537)
- [windows/mac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/)

## IMPORTANT

barely anything is done in this project yet, its just something im doing in my spare time to improve at Reverse engineering. i highly suggest that you dont use this until it has a lot of important functions decompiled

## Current Projects

here are the parts of GD i am currently working on

- 1.0
    - Parsing algorithms

- 2.2
    - Parsing Algorithms
    - gamesave

## want to know more about the game?
