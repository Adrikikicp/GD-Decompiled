# GD-Decompiled
 an attempt to get the source code for Geometry Dash through reverse engineering and decompiling the game

## IMPORTANT

barely anything is done in this project yet, its just something im doing in my spare time to improve at Reverse engineering. i highly suggest that you dont use this until it has a lot of important functions decompiled

## Current Projects

here are the parts of GD i am currently working on

- 1.0
    - Parsing algorithms

- 2.2
    - Parsing Algorithms
    - gamesave

## want to know more about the game?

if you want to know about the game and how various aspects work, you can find documentation [here](https://github.com/Wyliemaster/gddocs)
